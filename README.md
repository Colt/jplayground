jPlayground
==================

A set of jQuery Exercises 

Fork the project and clone YOUR version of the repo


Write your answers into the pre-prepared js files in the app/assets/javascripts/grounds/*.js

You can add gems and files to the app if you want to, but the exercises don't require this tho
